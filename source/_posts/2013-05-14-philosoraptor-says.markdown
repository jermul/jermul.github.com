I'm sorry, I lied to you all in my last blog entry...<!-- more-->

I told you that I was super persistent and super driven. Well, that's not entirely true. The truth is, I am those things but only because I find programming so damn fun.

I've never been terribly diligent. I haven't made a New Years Resolution in over a decade because I know I most likely won't keep it. I never stick to diets for very long. And, I still can't dunk a basketball, even though I promised myself I one day would (still holding out hope on this one).

And then along comes programming into my life. Lazy you say? [Chris Pine says to be proactively lazy!](http://pragprog.com/book/ltp2/learn-to-program) What's that? You're a glutton? Gorge yourself on a cornucopia of knowledge that would make Thanksgivings itself blush:

Here's the thing with me. If I really like something, it's much easier to motivate myself to get through the tedious stuff to get to the awesome stuff. I'll let my buddy Philosoraptor sum it up:
