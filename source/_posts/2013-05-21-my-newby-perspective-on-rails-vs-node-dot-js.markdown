For a time I was looking into Node.js vs. Rails because Node was/is hailed as the next best thing...<!-- more --> Yet AFAIK the *[debate rages on](http://venturebeat.com/2012/08/21/node-infographic/)* amongst people much more knowledgeable than I(check the comments section). As a beginning developer, I came to believe that I would need experience in both to make a fair assessment for myself.

It's like the debate on luxury cars; is a Lamborghini better than a Ferrari? I'm sure they each out-perform the other in certain tests. But only each individual person can determine for themselves which aspects they more heavily weigh, to form their opinion on which car is better.

 Unfortunately for me, I can't afford both a Lambo and a Ferrari to compare. I can't currently afford to learn Node.js right now either. That would be a lot of 'Going Sideways' as my instructor Chris Lee from Tealeaf Academy would say. I would risk learning redundantly before I was even fully comfortable with the Rails framework.

Better for me to learn a single language and framework and build a comprehensive skill set. At the same time, I am focused on building a strong foundation in Computer Science mentality. But, as long as I have that solid foundation, I can later add to my skill set with any new languages, modules, libraries, frameworks, etc. as required.

And for the record, Ferraris are better than Lambos.
