 It's been a few months now, and I feel I have a confession to make: I have had a mistress, and her name is Ruby.<!-- more -->I spend day and night with her. I eat with her, I play with her, I work with her. Even when I'm not with Ruby, I am constantly thinking about her, even dreaming about her. 

The best thing is that my wife totally supports it. The purpose of my blog is to detail my path to enlightenment of getting to know Ruby, and to create a website that will display my new found love.
