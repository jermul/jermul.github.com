    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
  It's been a few months now, and I feel I have a confession to make: I have had a mistress, and her name is Ruby...<!-- more --> I spend day and night with her. I eat with her, I play with her, I work with her. Even when I'm not with Ruby, I am constantly thinking about her, even dreaming about her. 
</p>


<p>
  The best thing is that my wife totally supports it.  
</p>


<p>
    I thought about extending the analogy to Rails as well, but we won't go there. I have decided dedicate myself to becoming a Ruby on Rails web developer. The purpose of my blog is to detail my path to enlightenment of getting to know Ruby and Rails, and to profess my love by documenting it.
