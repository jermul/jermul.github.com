    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p> It's been a few months now, and I feel I have a confession to make: I have had a mistress, and her name is Ruby.<!-- more --> I spend day and night with her. I eat with her, I play with her, I work with her. Even when I'm not with Ruby, I am constantly thinking about her, even dreaming about her.</p>

<p>The best thing is that my wife totally supports it. The purpose of my blog is to detail my path to enlightenment of getting to know Ruby, and to create a website that will display my new found love. I thought about including the rails analogy as well, but we won't go there.</p>
